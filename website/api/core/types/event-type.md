# Event<P>

## Kind

- interface

## Description

Event unit shape.

## Example

```ts twoslash
import { event, type Event } from '@suzumiyaaoba/scope-flux-core';

const increment: Event<{ step: number }> = event({ id: 'increment' });
increment.kind;
// ^? "event"
```

## Notes

- This example shows how to consume the type in application code.
- For exact structural details, compare with Typedoc.

## Where This Type Is Used

- Appears in public API signatures and composition boundaries for this module.
- Useful for app-level contracts, shared utility wrappers, and test helpers.

## Design Guidance

- Keep this type at API boundaries; avoid over-coupling internal business logic to tooling types.
- If you need runtime semantics, pair this page with the corresponding function docs.

## Review Checklist

- Is the type used at module boundaries where type safety matters most?
- Are literal unions handled exhaustively in your code (`switch`/guards)?
- Is the type aligned with serialization and observability constraints?
